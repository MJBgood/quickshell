# Quickshell Hyprland Interface Architecture

## Core Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Presentation Layer**: Pure QML components focused on visual representation
- **Logic Layer**: Singleton services handling state management and business logic  
- **Data Layer**: Models and data providers for system information
- **Configuration Layer**: Centralized settings and theming system

### 2. **Component Modularity**
- Each UI component should be self-contained and reusable
- Components communicate through well-defined interfaces (properties/signals)
- No direct dependencies between sibling components
- Parent components orchestrate child component interactions

### 3. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
- System integrations (Hyprland, audio, network) wrapped in singleton services
- Services expose reactive properties and methods
- Services handle all external API calls and data transformation
- UI components consume services through clean interfaces

### 4. **Reactive State Management**
- All state changes flow through centralized stores/services
- Property bindings ensure automatic UI updates
- Avoid imperative state mutations in UI components
- Use signals/slots for event-driven communication

### 5. **Resource Efficiency & Lazy Loading**
- **Lazy loading strategy**: load only what's needed, when it's needed
- **Defer expensive operations** until user interaction requires them
- **Use Loader components** to conditionally load UI elements
- **Load active configuration/themes only**, discover alternatives on-demand
- **Minimize memory footprint and startup time**
- **Use first-party Quickshell solutions** (Quickshell.Io, etc.) instead of reinventing functionality

## Design Patterns

### 1. **Service Singleton Pattern**
```qml
// services/WindowService.qml
pragma Singleton
import QtQuick

QtObject {
    id: windowService
    
    property var activeWindow: null
    property var workspaces: []
    
    signal windowChanged(var window)
    signal workspaceChanged(int id)
    
    function focusWindow(id) { /* implementation */ }
    function moveToWorkspace(windowId, workspaceId) { /* implementation */ }
}
```

### 2. **Component Interface Pattern**
```qml
// components/common/BaseWidget.qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    id: root
    
    // Public API
    property alias title: titleText.text
    property bool enabled: true
    
    // Signals for external communication
    signal clicked()
    signal toggled(bool state)
    
    // Internal implementation
    // ...
}
```

### 3. **Configuration Injection Pattern**
```qml
// config/theme/Theme.qml
pragma Singleton
import QtQuick

QtObject {
    readonly property QtObject colors: QtObject {
        readonly property color primary: "#89b4fa"
        readonly property color background: "#1e1e2e"
        readonly property color surface: "#313244"
    }
    
    readonly property QtObject spacing: QtObject {
        readonly property int small: 4
        readonly property int medium: 8
        readonly property int large: 16
    }
}
```

## Component Communication Rules

### 1. **Parent-Child Communication**
- Parents configure children through properties
- Children notify parents through signals
- Avoid direct property access across component boundaries

### 2. **Sibling Communication**
- Always route through parent component or shared service
- Use service signals for global state changes
- Avoid direct references between siblings

### 3. **Service Integration**
- Components declare service dependencies explicitly
- Services remain stateless where possible
- Service methods return reactive properties, not raw data

## Error Handling Strategy

### 1. **Graceful Degradation**
- Components should handle missing services gracefully
- Provide fallback UI states for failed data loads
- Log errors without breaking the entire interface

### 2. **Service Resilience**
- Services should retry failed operations with backoff
- Maintain last-known-good state during outages
- Emit error signals for UI components to handle

### 3. **Development vs Production**
- Debug mode shows detailed error information
- Production mode shows user-friendly error states
- All errors logged to system journal

## Performance Guidelines

### 1. **Lazy Loading**
- Use Loader components for expensive UI elements
- Load overlay panels only when user interacts with them
- Defer initialization of non-critical services until needed
- **Theme System**: Load only active theme on startup, discover all themes when theme selector opens
- **Configuration**: Load active settings only, scan for alternatives on-demand

### 2. **Efficient Updates**
- Minimize property binding complexity
- Use first-party solutions (SystemTime, etc.) instead of custom timers
- Batch UI updates where possible
- **Resource Conservation**: Update only when display actually changes (minutes for clock, not seconds)

### 3. **Memory Management**
- Destroy temporary components when hidden
- Limit model sizes for large datasets
- Use object pools for frequently created items
- **First-Party APIs**: Always prefer Quickshell.Io over external processes when available

## Testing Strategy

### 1. **Component Testing**
- Each component should be testable in isolation
- Mock services for component testing
- Visual regression tests for complex layouts

### 2. **Service Testing**
- Unit tests for service logic
- Integration tests for system service connections
- Mock system APIs for reliable testing

### 3. **End-to-End Testing**
- Automated testing of common user workflows
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Cross-resolution compatibility testing

## Development Workflow

### 1. **Feature Development**
1. Design component interface (properties/signals)
2. Implement service layer if needed
3. Create component with mock data
4. Integrate with real services
5. Add error handling and edge cases
6. Write tests and documentation

### 2. **Code Review Standards**
- All services must have defined interfaces
- Components must handle loading/error states
- Performance impact assessed for UI changes
- Accessibility considerations documented

### 3. **Refactoring Guidelines**
- Extract common patterns into base components
- Consolidate similar services
- Optimize hot paths identified through profiling
- Maintain backward compatibility for configurations

## Future Extensibility

### 1. **Plugin Architecture**
- Services designed for easy extension
- Component registration system for plugins
- Configuration schema for new features

### 2. **Theme System**
- Complete visual customization through themes
- Runtime theme switching capability
- Theme validation and fallbacks

### 3. **Cross-Platform Considerations**
- Abstract window manager interactions
- Configurable service implementations
- Platform-specific component variants

This architecture ensures maintainability, testability, and extensibility while following QML best practices and modern software design principles.
