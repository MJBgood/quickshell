# Quickshell Hyprland Interface

A sophisticated, maintainable desktop shell interface for Hyprland built with modern QML architecture and strong separation of concerns.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project aims to create a clean but complex interface for Hyprland that showcases:
- **Modern Architecture**: Service-oriented design with reactive state management
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular components
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture and comprehensive theming system
- **Performance**: Efficient updates and lazy loading strategies

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct layers for presentation, logic, data, and configuration
- **Component Modularity**: Self-contained, reusable components with clean interfaces
- **Service-Oriented Design**: System integrations wrapped in singleton services
- **Reactive State Management**: Property bindings ensure automatic UI updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Hyprland**: Modern wayland compositor
- **Qt 6**: QML runtime environment
- **Quickshell**: QML-based shell toolkit

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or copy to your quickshell config directory
cp -r . ~/.config/quickshell/

# Test the configuration
quickshell ~/.config/quickshell/shell.qml
```

- **[Development Roadmap](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)**: Chronological development plan with milestones

## 🎨 Features (Planned)

### Phase 1: Foundation
- ✅ Project scaffolding with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Base component templates and theming system
- ✅ Core services (Theme, Config, Hyprland)
- ✅ State management with stores

### Phase 2: Essential Interface
- 🔄 Status bar with workspace indicators
- 🔄 System tray integration
- 🔄 Media controls with MPRIS support
- 🔄 System information widgets

### Phase 3: Power User Features
- ⏳ Application launcher with fuzzy search
- ⏳ Window management and overview
- ⏳ Productivity widgets (calendar, weather)

### Phase 4: Advanced Customization
- ⏳ Dynamic theming system
- ⏳ Configuration UI
- ⏳ Plugin architecture

### Phase 5: Polish & Performance
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Comprehensive testing
- ⏳ Documentation and community

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Adding New Components
1. Design component interface (properties/signals)
2. Implement with mock data first
3. Integrate with real services
4. Add error handling and edge cases
5. Write tests and documentation

### Code Standards
- All services must have defined interfaces
- Components must handle loading/error states
- Performance impact assessed for UI changes
- Accessibility considerations documented

## 🎨 Theming

The project uses a comprehensive design system based on:
- **Color Palette**: Catppuccin-inspired with semantic colors
- **Typography**: Inter font family with consistent sizing
- **Spacing**: 8px base unit system
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions with consistent timing

Theme customization is available through the `Theme` singleton and can be modified at runtime.

## 🤝 Contributing

This project follows modern software development practices:
- **Clean Architecture**: Service-oriented design patterns
- **Reactive Programming**: QML property bindings and signals
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback
- **Testing**: Component isolation and service mocking
